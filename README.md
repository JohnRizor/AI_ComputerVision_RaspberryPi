<h1 align="center">Raspberry Pi Computer Vision </h1>

_______
The purpose of this project was to gain knowledge utilizing computer vision and APIs. I was able to program my Raspberry Pi to utilize TensorFlow in Python to analyze webcam video into objects known by the computer. This is just one step into understanding the capabilities of AI and Machine Learning.
